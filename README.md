# polygit

Interactive polyrepo git dashboard. Discovers every git repo under a directory and shows their status in a two-pane TUI — pulling them in parallel with live per-repo logs, with retry/refetch support, a persisted status cache, and configurable auto-pull. Built in Rust with ratatui.

📖 **Documentation: https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit**

## Features

- **Recursive discovery** (default): crawls the directory tree in parallel for git repos, pruning hidden / `node_modules` / `vendor` / `target` / `*.worktrees` dirs and never descending into a found repo — so `polygit ~/projects` (or even `~`) just works. Repos stream in and start pulling as they're found; `--depth N` caps it, `--no-recursive` restores a single-level scan
- **Directory-tree view** (`v t`): render the repos as a collapsible folder tree, with per-folder status rollups; orthogonal to grouping, so you can have flat, grouped, tree, or **tree + groups** (groups subdivide repos inside each folder)
- Parallel pulls with configurable concurrency (default: nproc); the list title shows live concurrency (`⇄ active/cap`)
- Live log streaming per repo in a scrollable **Command log** pane (the right pane, titled `[2] Command log · <repo> · <status>`)
- Status glyphs: queued / running / up-to-date / updated / no-upstream / skipped / throttled / failed — plus an optional **status text column** (`t u`) that spells them out and names the failure kind on failed repos (`not found` / `auth` / `diverged` / `not a repo` / `timeout` / `network` / `lock`)
- Branches with no upstream are a distinct **no-upstream** state (`▽`), not a failure — kept off the Errors page and counted as done. A branch whose tracked remote ref was deleted (PR merged → "no such ref was fetched") is treated the same way, not as a red failure
- **Throttle adaptation**: detects remote rate-limiting (HTTP 429 / "rate limit" / SSH connection throttling) as a distinct **throttled** state (`↯`), shows a warning banner, automatically halves concurrency, and re-queues throttled repos with exponential backoff — restoring full concurrency once the remote is quiet
- Automatic one-shot retry of a failed pull before marking it failed — skipped for permanent errors (repository not found, auth failure, diverged branch) where retrying can't change the result
- Dynamic `Errors (N)` page (after `Result`) listing each failed repo with its error output
- **What the pull delivered**: optional **pulled** (`t p`, `⇣N` commits) and **changed** (`t c`, `±N` files) columns showing what each repo's pull landed this run; the info panel's **Pulled** row spells out the full delta — `oldsha → newsha · N commits · M files (+ins −del) · N new tags · N new branches` — and the panel re-fetches after a pull so its numbers reflect the new HEAD
- **Optional auto-pull + status cache**: launches are useful instantly — the list is seeded from a persisted per-repo status cache (last-known status shown **dim with an age**, e.g. `up-to-date 2d`, until pulled). Auto-pull-on-launch is configurable in Settings (master on/off · a max-repos limit `50/100/250/∞` · suppress in tree view); by default it pulls small flat sets and **skips** large sets (>100) and the tree view. When auto-pull is suppressed, `E` pulls everything / `e` pulls the selected repo on demand
- Retry repos with an issue (`r` / `R`) and refetch any repo from scratch (`e` / `E`) — a refetch re-pulls **and** refreshes every cached fact (branch/dirty/stash counts, ahead/behind, worktrees)
- Action hints dim when they'd be a no-op
- Worktree discovery (`.worktrees/*/.git`)
- Sort the list (`s` leader, or click a column header) by name / branch / status / ahead-behind / dirty / last-commit / worktrees / branches / stashes / pulled / changed — re-pick or re-click flips `▲`/`▼` (persisted; the list is always sorted, Name asc by default). The sort menu lists only the columns currently visible
- Filter repos by name (`/`) — or **by status/attribute** by prepending `@` (e.g. `@failed`, `@dirty`, `@ahead`, `@behind`, `@updated`); the prompt hints at it. Also a quick status filter via the `f` leader (updated / up-to-date / skipped / failed / issues)
- **Repo groups** (`z`): named list sections from `~/.config/polygit/groups.json` — membership by `*`-pattern, static list, shell command, or a fetched JSON document; sort/filter apply within each group, big groups collapse (`Enter`/`Space`/click on the header), dynamic memberships are cached and refreshed with `Z`
- Clickable 2-row column header with the active sort indicator; an always-on dirty marker (`•`) with the count (`•N`) when the dirty column is toggled. Count columns render a **dim zero** (not a blank), and a column every repo lacks (no worktrees/stashes, ≤1 branch) auto-hides — its `t`-menu chip goes dim and inert
- Lazygit-style panes: rounded borders, a bright border on the focused pane (`Tab` / `1` / `2`), and a draggable divider with a grip
- Open [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) on the selected repo with `l`
- Diff modal with a clickable file list over the selected file's diff (stash, uncommitted, vs base branch, or **a branch's changes vs its base**); `Tab` switches focus between the file list and diff, with a footer that adapts to the focused pane; **status-filter chips** (`f` / click) with count badges when a change set has >10 files across ≥2 statuses; `Shift`/`Alt`+`PgUp`/`PgDn` page the file list; "no changes" shows a toast instead of an empty modal
- Draggable scrollbars everywhere (preview, diff panels, help, repo page), highlighted while dragged
- Tabbed, **context-aware** help modal (`?`): **Hotkeys** (for the current view) · **CLI & Flags** · **Legend** (every glyph, both icon sets) · **About**, switched with `Tab`/click (last tab remembered). The Hotkeys tab's `[K ⌨ keyboard]` (or `K`) pops a **responsive interactive keyboard viewer** — a full-blown bordered keyboard when there's room (compact strip when not), nav cluster on the right, every bound key highlighted; press/click any key (physical `Shift`/`Ctrl` too) to list what it does
- Settings modal (`,`), four sections: **General** (panel padding · grouping · tree view), **Theming** (Unicode ⇄ emoji icons · **theme** auto/dark/light · independent **background** normal/soft/**terminal** · **contrast** normal/soft), **Sync** (auto-pull on launch · auto-pull limit `50/100/250/∞` · auto-pull in tree view), and **Mouse** (**hover effects**) — all persisted; rows and radio chips are mouse-clickable. The `auto` theme **re-detects** dark/light at runtime, so an OS light↔dark switch re-themes live (no restart)
- **Hover effects** (off by default): when on, the actionable element under the mouse cursor (status-bar commands, footer hints, table-sort headers, column chips, info links/copy buttons, scrollbars, the splitter, list rows) gets a subtle highlight. A status-bar command's key and its label highlight together; sortable column headers highlight too; and dwelling ~1s on a status-bar command shows a tooltip describing it. It enables all-motion mouse tracking, which takes over the terminal's own text selection / URL hover — so it's opt-in
- Web-like mouse support everywhere: full status-bar hints + active `⟪sort⟫`/`[filter]` tags clickable, every modal gets an `[x]` and closes on outside click, repo page has an `[esc back]` button
- **New-build reload notice**: detects a newer binary installed over the running one and offers a one-click `[reload]` (exec-restart in the same terminal)
- Non-TUI fallback (same output as bash reference) when not on a TTY or with `--no-tui`
- Exit codes: 0 (all ok), 1 (any failed), 2 (user quit mid-run), 130 (Ctrl-C)

## Installing

polygit is a single binary for **Linux and macOS** (on Windows, use WSL).

```bash
# Install script — grabs the prebuilt binary for your platform
curl -fsSL https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit/install.sh | bash

# Or with cargo (no clone needed)
cargo install --git https://github.com/steven-pribilinskiy/polygit

# Or from source
make build              # release build → ~/bin/polygit
```

See the [installation docs](https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit/start/installation/) for details.

**Retry vs refetch:** retry only re-runs repos that need it (failed/skipped); refetch re-runs any repo even if it was already up to date. In the status bar, `r`/`R` dim when no repo has an issue, and `e`/`E` dim when there's nothing eligible (the selected repo is still in progress).

The repo list, the log/diff preview, the help modal, and the repo page all show a scrollbar when their content overflows. **Clickable commands:** the action hints in the status bar (and the `t` column menu) are mouse-clickable — clicking one runs the same command as the key.

### Repo page (`Enter` / double-click)

Opens a full-screen page for the selected repo that runs `git fetch` and lists every local branch (with HEAD marker, fresh ahead/behind vs upstream, upstream name, last-commit date, subject), every worktree (branch + path), and every stash. A header row labels the branch columns, which are toggled with the page-local `t` menu (then `b`/`y`/`a`/`m`/`d`/`c`/`u`/`f`/`g`/`s` for ahead-behind / dirty / added / modified / deleted / total / upstream / base / age / subject — clickable chips, persisted). The **added/modified/deleted** counts are each branch's changes vs the merge-base with its **base branch** — the auto-detected fork parent (the branch it most directly diverged from, weighing both local heads and remote-tracking branches, so a branch cut from a non-`main` integration branch resolves correctly), or a per-branch **override** you set — loaded in the background (cells show `…` until ready); a column every branch leaves empty auto-hides and its chip goes dim. The **base** column shows that resolved base per branch (blue when auto-detected, magenta with a trailing `*` when overridden). Count cells show a dim zero rather than a blank. The bottom **info panel** (`i`, persisted) details the selected row: branch, upstream, base branch + merge-base sha, ahead/behind, change stats, and the tip commit (sha · author · date · subject). Sections are prefixed with type icons; worktrees/stashes sections only appear when non-empty. The selection starts on the current (HEAD) branch. Navigate rows with `j`/`k`/`g`/`G`/`Home`/`End` (or the wheel / click); `Enter` (or double-click) opens the diff modal on a stash, a dirty row, or **a branch (its changes vs the base branch)**; `Shift+Enter` checks out the selected branch (clean, non-current); `p`/`P` fast-forward; `d` performs the row-appropriate action (delete branch / drop stash / remove worktree / discard) — the footer hint is dynamic; `b` (or clicking the **base** cell) opens the **base-branch picker** to override which branch this branch's stats diff against — pick *auto-detect* to clear the override; the choice is persisted per repo+branch; `c` starts claude code; `l` opens lazygit; `o` opens the branch on the remote (e.g. GitHub) in the browser; `y` opens a copy menu (absolute path / branch name / both); `?` shows the page's hotkeys; `Esc`/`q` returns. An action result (e.g. "Dropped stash@{0}") shows in a banner at the bottom.

`Enter` or a double-click opens a 90%-of-screen **diff modal**, two bordered sub-panels: a scrollable **file-list panel** (top, ≤40% height) over the **selected file's diff** (bottom). The footer adapts to the focused pane. `Tab` switches focus between the panels (the focused one gets a bright border); `j`/`k`/`g`/`G` then drive that panel. Pick a file with `↑↓`/`j`/`k` or by clicking it; its diff loads beneath. `PgUp`/`PgDn` page the diff; `Shift`/`Alt`+`PgUp`/`PgDn` page the file list; `Shift`/`Alt`+wheel scrolls the file list. When a change set has more than 10 files across at least two statuses, a **status-filter chip row** appears (`[ all N ] [ M … ] [ A … ] …` with count badges) — click a chip or press `f` to cycle, and the list groups by status. The diff-panel title shows the full path, left-truncating only when it doesn't fit. For a dirty row, `t` toggles the file set between *uncommitted* (vs HEAD) and *vs base branch*; a stash lists its files; a clean branch shows its changes vs the base branch. `d` discards/removes/drops (with confirm); `Esc` closes. When there's nothing to show, a "no changes" toast appears instead of an empty modal.

### Columns (`t` leader)

The list always shows the status glyph + name + branch + a dirty marker (an amber `•` for any repo with uncommitted changes — amber, not red, since it's a "modified" state, not an error). Press `t` then a column key to toggle extra columns: `u` status text (a short label per state — `queued`/`running`/`up-to-date`/`updated`/`no upstream`/`dirty`/`throttled` — with the specific failure kind on failed repos: `not found`, `auth`, `diverged`, `not a repo`, `timeout`, `network`, `lock`, and `ref gone` for a deleted upstream ref), `a` ahead/behind, `d` adds the dirty **count** (`•N`) to the always-on marker, `l` last-commit age, `w` worktree count (`⑃N`, cyan), `b` feature-branch count (`⑂N`, green — local branches excluding `main`/`dev`), `s` stash count (`≡N`), `p` commits the last pull landed (`⇣N`, green), `c` files the last pull changed (`±N`, cyan). Count columns render a **dim zero** rather than a blank, so the column shape stays recognizable. A column every repo leaves empty (no worktrees, no stashes, or ≤1 branch everywhere) auto-hides once its data has loaded, and its `t`-menu chip goes dim and inert; the **pulled**/**changed** columns auto-hide once the run finishes having pulled nothing. The git-derived columns fetch per-repo details in the background the first time one is enabled (cells show `…` until ready); `w` is free from worktree discovery, and pulled/changed come straight from each pull. Enabled columns persist across runs.

### Info panel (`i`)

`i` toggles an info block above the right pane's content (the pull log or the diff) for the selected repo: status (with how long the pull took), branch, the **Pulled** delta when the repo updated this run (`oldsha → newsha` on one line, then `N commits · M files (+ins −del)`, then best-effort `N new tags · N new branches`), ahead/behind, remote, last commit (hash · subject · author · relative date), worktrees, uncommitted/stash counts, and the local path. The block is additive — the log/diff stays beneath it — and tracks the selection as you move. The extra git facts are fetched lazily for the selected repo only, and re-fetched after a pull so the panel reflects the new HEAD.

The panel is interactive (it's a web app in a terminal):

- **Bold field labels**; rows that would carry nothing are hidden — no `↑0 ↓0`, no all-zero Changes line, no empty Worktrees.
- **Clickable links** (when the remote is a browsable https host): the **branch** opens `…/tree/<branch>`, the **commit hash** opens `…/commit/<sha>`, and **Remote** opens the repo — all in your browser.
- **Truncated values expand on click.** The path is truncated from the *left* (keeping the filename tail); a long commit subject from the right. Click the underlined value to expand it — the full text wraps starting at the value column, never under the label. Click again to collapse.
- **Copy buttons**: a `⧉` next to **Path** copies the absolute path; a `⧉` on the log pane's top border copies the whole pull log.

`c` starts claude code (`cc`, i.e. `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, in the repo dir; override with `PULL_CLAUDE_CMD`).

### Settings modal (`,`)

`,` opens a small settings modal (from the list or the repo page), organized into **General** (panel padding, grouping, tree view), **Theming** (icons, theme, background, contrast, selection style), **Sync** (auto-pull policy), **Interaction** (hover effects, changed-row flash/highlight), and **Layout** (borders, splitter, repo-page tabs) sections. By default it's a **tabbed** (JetBrains-style) layout — the sections are vertical tabs on the left; switch tabs with `←`/`→` or `Tab`, move between rows with `j`/`k` (or `↑`/`↓`), toggle/cycle the selected setting with `Space`/`Enter`, and close with `Esc`/`q`/`,`/`[x]`/a click outside. Press `v` (hint in the bottom border) to switch to a **flat** layout that stacks every section in one scroll. With the mouse, click a tab to switch, a row label to select it, or a radio chip to set that value directly. With hover effects on, dwelling ~1s over a setting shows a tooltip explaining it (e.g. the **unicode** icon option notes that Unicode glyphs can be colorized per type, unlike emoji). All settings persist across runs (in `~/.config/polygit/state.json`):

- **Panel padding** — adds a 1-cell inner padding inside every bordered panel and modal.
- **Icons** — switches the status / column / marker glyphs **everywhere** (list, columns, repo page, Result/Errors pages, log markers) between the default Unicode set (`◌ ✓ ◇ ✗ ⑂ ≡ •`) and an emoji set (`✅ ✨ 🚫 ❌ 🌿 📦 📝`). Columns stay aligned in either mode — only single-codepoint, reliably-2-cell emoji are used (no variation-selector glyphs), and the tight ahead/behind column keeps compact `↑↓` arrows.
- **Theme** — `dark` / `light` paint a full explicit palette (background, text, and every accent color) so the app looks identical regardless of the terminal's own color scheme. `auto` detects whether the terminal background is dark or light at startup and applies the matching palette — via an OSC 11 query of the terminal, falling back to `COLORFGBG`, the Windows light/dark setting under WSL (covers terminals that follow the system theme but don't answer OSC 11, e.g. Tabby), and the macOS appearance setting.
- **Background** and **Contrast** — two independent `normal` / `soft` axes. **Background** softens the surface tones (background, selection, shadow); **Contrast** narrows the text/background distance and desaturates the accent + semantic colors. They compose, so you can soften the surface while keeping vivid text, or vice versa. (Pre-split state files, which had only `contrast`, load with both axes set from the old value.)
- **Changed-row flash / highlight** — how a repo row signals that a pull/refresh changed one of its cells. **flash** pulses the changed cells; **highlight** holds them steady for the attention window. Independent toggles (turn both off to rely on the status text column instead).
- **Borders** — draw the rounded borders around the two main panes. Off reclaims the border rows/columns (the pane titles float on the top row and content fills the freed space).
- **Splitter** — draw the draggable grip on the divider between the panes. Off hides the grip (the panes sit flush); you can still resize by dragging the boundary.
- **Repo page tabs** — `off` keeps the repo page as one scrolling list; `auto` splits it into **Branches / Worktrees / Stashes / Commits tabs** when at least two sections have content (switch with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` or click a tab chip). The **Commits** tab lists recent commits on the current branch (sha · date · author · subject), read-only.
- **Selection** — how the selected row is highlighted, applied everywhere a row can be selected (the repo list, the repo page, the diff file list). `blue` is a solid blue bar with white text (high contrast, but it overrides each column's own color); `subtle` is a soft blue tint that keeps the per-column colors (status hue, branch accent, …) readable — better for these color-coded tables. Hovering the selected row deepens the tint in either mode, so it stays distinct from a plain hover.
- **Grouping** — render the list as named group sections (same as `v g`). Shows a hint when no `groups.json` exists.
- **Tree view** — render the repos as a collapsible directory tree (same as `v t`). Inert when every repo is at the scan root (a flat directory).

### Repo groups (`v g`)

`v g` renders the list as named **group sections** defined in `~/.config/polygit/groups.json` (hand-edited, optional — never written by the app). When groups are configured, a clickable `vg groups` hint appears in the status bar (its label brightens while the grouped view is active). Each group header shows per-status counts and the member total; repos inside a group keep the global sort and filters; repos matching no group land in a dim `ungrouped` section at the bottom. Groups with more members than `collapse_threshold` (default: 5) get a collapsible header — selectable, with `▾`/`▸`, toggled by `Enter`/`Space`/click; smaller groups get static headers navigation skips. The grouping toggle and collapsed groups persist across runs.

Each group has a `name` and exactly one membership source:

```json
{
  "collapse_threshold": 5,
  "cache_ttl_minutes": 1440,
  "groups": [
    { "name": "frontend", "pattern": "mfe-*" },
    { "name": "tooling", "repos": ["polygit", "dotfiles"] },
    { "name": "team", "command": "curl -fsSL https://example.com/repos.txt" },
    { "name": "platform", "url": "https://example.com/remote-entries.json",
      "extract": { "pointer": "/entries", "kind": "keys" } }
  ]
}
```

`pattern` is a case-insensitive `*`-wildcard on repo names — **or, when it contains a `/`, on the repo's path relative to the scan root** (e.g. `work/*`); `repos` is a static list; `command` runs a shell command whose stdout lines are repo names; `url` fetches a JSON document and extracts names per `extract` (a JSON pointer + `keys`/`values`). Dynamic (`command`/`url`) sources resolve in the background — never blocking startup — and are cached in `~/.config/polygit/groups-cache.json` for `cache_ttl_minutes` (default: daily). `Z` forces a refresh; a failed resolve keeps the cached membership and marks the header with `⚠`. Selecting a group header shows a group summary (source, counts, cache age, errors) in the preview pane. Full reference: [Repo groups guide](https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit/guides/groups/).

### Directory tree (`v t`)

Recursive discovery is the default: `polygit` crawls the target directory in parallel for git repos (pruning hidden dirs, `node_modules`/`vendor`/`target`/`dist`/… and `*.worktrees`, and never descending into a found repo), streaming each repo in and starting its pull as soon as it's found. `--depth N` caps the descent (`--depth 1` / `--no-recursive` is the legacy single-level scan). In flat and grouped views, each repo shows its path relative to the scan root (e.g. `personal/polygit`).

`v t` renders that result as a **collapsible directory tree**: folders become headers (`▾`/`▸`) with their subtree's status rollup and repo count, repos nest beneath by basename. Tree and grouping are **two independent toggles**, so four views are reachable:

- **flat** — every repo in one list (default)
- **grouped** (`v g`) — repos in `groups.json` sections, regardless of folder
- **tree** (`v t`) — the folder hierarchy
- **tree + groups** (both on) — groups subdivide the repos *inside each folder*; a group collapses independently per folder

Fold the tree with the mouse (click a folder header), `←`/`→` (collapse/expand or jump to the parent), `Enter`/`Space` (toggle the selected header), the direct keys `-` (collapse all) / `+` (expand all) / `*` (expand the selected subtree), or the vim-style `z` chord (`za`/`zo`/`zc`/`zO`/`zM`/`zR`). The tree toggle and collapsed-folder set persist across runs. Full reference: [Tree view guide](https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit/guides/tree-view/).

### Sorting (`s` leader / column headers)

The list is always sorted — **Name ascending** is the default. Press `s` then a column key (`n` name, `c` branch, `s` status, `a` ahead/behind, `d` dirty, `l` last-commit, `w` worktrees, `b` branches, `k` stashes, `p` pulled commits, `g` changed files) — or click a column header (including the **branch** header). The sort menu only lists columns currently visible on screen. Re-picking the same column (or re-clicking the header) flips the direction; the header shows `▲`/`▼` on the active column and the footer shows a clickable `⟪column ▲⟫` tag. The order persists across runs.

### Help modal (`?`)

`?` opens an in-app reference with four tabs — **Hotkeys** (contextual, with short sections laid out side by side), **CLI & Flags** (an **interactive command builder** — toggle/fill flags, see the `polygit …` command update live, and `y`/click **[ copy ]** to copy it; plus exit codes), **Legend** (every glyph in both icon sets with its meaning), and **About** — switched with `Tab` (the last tab is remembered across opens, except About). The About tab groups its links (**polygit** docs + GitHub, **lazygit**, and a collapsible **Notes** group you expand with a click) and shows **titles only** — hover a link to see its URL in the bottom-left corner (browser-style), or dwell ~1s for a tooltip. The links are clickable (open in your browser via `$BROWSER`/`wslview`/`xdg-open`). Scroll with `j`/`k`, `g`/`G`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, or the wheel; **maximize/restore** the modal to ~90% of the viewport with `m` (or the `[m maximize]` button); close with `?`/`Esc`/`q`/`[esc]`/a click outside.

On the **Hotkeys** tab, `[K ⌨ keyboard]` (or pressing `K`) opens an interactive keyboard viewer (the same one on the [docs site](https://steven-pribilinskiy.github.io/polygit/guides/keybindings/), built from the same keymap): an OS-aware on-screen keyboard with the bound keys highlighted, and the nav/arrow cluster (home/end/pgup/pgdn + arrows) to its right. It's responsive — on a large terminal the keys grow into a full-blown keyboard of tall bordered keys; on a small one it falls back to a compact strip with the cluster below. Press or click any key — including physical `Shift`/`Ctrl` (on terminals with the Kitty keyboard protocol) — to highlight it and list everything it does in a scrollable panel below, whose keys column auto-sizes to the longest combo shown; `Esc` closes the viewer.

### Mouse

Click a repo row to select it (a click also **focuses** whichever pane it lands
in, like the `1`/`2`/`Tab` keys), scroll the wheel over the left pane to move the
selection or over the right pane to scroll the preview, click or drag the preview
scrollbar to jump/scroll, and drag the divider between the panes to resize. Hold a
modifier while scrolling to go faster: **Shift** jumps 5× the normal step, **Ctrl**
or **Alt** scrolls a full page at a time (works on the list, the preview, and the
repo page). While the TUI is running it captures the mouse, so native terminal
text-selection is suspended until you quit (same tradeoff as lazygit/htop).

Everything actionable is clickable like a web page:

- **Status-bar hints** — the whole hint ("s sort", "f by-status", "/ filter", …), not just the key. While a leader menu is armed (e.g. `f`/`s`/`t`) the rest of the footer dims and goes inert, and the armed leader's own trigger gets a highlight pill so it's clear which menu is open. The active tags sit next to their hints and are clickable too: `⟪name ▲⟫` flips the sort direction, `[needle]` clears the name filter, `{failed}` resets the status filter. In "[ ] resize", `[` and `]` nudge the split directly. The right side shows the version, a clickable `built … ago` tag (opens the Build info modal), and clickable `, settings · ? help · q quit`.
- **Modals** (settings, copy menu, confirm, diff, help) — every modal has an `[x]` close button on its top border and closes/cancels when you click anywhere outside it. Clicks inside a modal never fall through to the view behind.
- **Settings** — click a row label to select it, or click a radio chip (`● dark`, `○ off`, …) to set that exact value.
- **Confirm dialogs** — `[y/enter] yes` and `[n] no` are clickable.
- **Copy menu** — click an option to copy it immediately.
- **Repo page** — a clickable `[esc back]` button on the top border returns to the list.

### New-build reload

While running, polygit watches its own binary on disk. When a newer build is installed (e.g. `make install`'s atomic rename), a persistent notice appears in the top-right (inset with the panel-padding setting, with a glint sweeping its border): `↺ new build installed · [reload] [x]`. It rides on top of every screen — the repo list, the full-screen repo page, and any open modal — so it's never hidden. `[reload]` restores the terminal and `exec`s the new binary with the same arguments — the fresh process re-scans and re-pulls (instant when everything is already up to date). `[x]` dismisses the notice; it re-arms if the binary changes again.

Clicking the **`built … ago`** tag in the status bar opens a **Build info** modal: the running version, the watched executable path, when it was built, how the new-build watch works, and whether a newer build is currently waiting. A `[restart]` button (or `r`) exec-restarts into the latest build; any other key or click closes it.

## Architecture

- `src/main.rs` — CLI entry point, TUI setup, event loop
- `src/app.rs` — Application state types (`AppState`, `RepoState`, `LogBuffer`) + retry/refetch eligibility helpers
- `src/git.rs` — Git operations + the recursive repo walker (`spawn_repo_walker`, `should_descend`) and pull-output classification (`classify_pull_output`, incl. throttle detection) + unit tests
- `src/worker.rs` — Async pull workers + streaming discovery (`run_discovery`) and the throttle governor (`run_governor`), bounded by the shared `ThrottleControl` semaphore
- `src/groups.rs` — Repo-grouping config, membership resolution, and cache
- `src/theme.rs` — Color palettes + terminal-background detection
- `src/render.rs` — Ratatui rendering (list pane, preview pane, status bar, ANSI color support)
- `src/plain.rs` — Non-TUI streaming output (byte-compatible with bash reference)
